End-to-End Data Analytics Case Study on Blinkit Grocery Sales using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.  This project involves data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation to extract key business insights.

# Blinkit Grocery Sales – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This is a complete **end-to-end data analytics project** on Blinkit's grocery sales data.  
The goal is to extract business insights using the full data analytics stack — **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**. This project showcases my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data using industry-relevant tools.

##  Project Objective

- Understand product performance and sales distribution
- Analyze customer preferences and outlet performance
- Identify trends across fat content, item type, and outlet location
- Build visual reports and dashboards for stakeholders

##  Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool        | Purpose                                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**  | Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib) |
| **SQL**     | Querying, grouping, aggregating, pivoting data         |
| **Excel**   | Pivot tables and quick summaries                       |
| **Power BI**| Interactive dashboard building                         |

By using all four tools on the same dataset, I gained **hands-on practical experience** with each.

##  Python Analysis

**File:** `Python-Analysis/blinkit_Analysis.ipynb`

- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned and transformed data
- Analyzed item sales, outlet size, fat content, and ratings
- Visualized results using bar charts, pie charts, and histograms

---

##  SQL Analysis

**File:** `SQL-Queries/blinkit_sql_queries.txt`

- Cleaned inconsistent entries (e.g., standardizing fat content values)
- Grouped data to compute total and average sales
- Created pivot tables for outlet type and location-based sales
- Analyzed sales by year of establishment and outlet size

---

##  Excel Summary

**File:** `Excel-Analysis/blinkit_analysis_excel.xlsx`

- Created pivot tables to:
  - Analyze sales by item type and outlet
  - Understand trends based on outlet size and fat content
- Visualized quick insights using Excel charts

---

##  Power BI Dashboard

**File:** `PowerBI-Dashboard/blinkit_dashboard.pbix`

- Interactive dashboard built to show:
  - KPIs: Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating
  - Sales by Item Type, Fat Content, Outlet Type, Location, and Size
  - Stacked bar charts, matrix cards, and donut charts

##  Key Insights

- Low Fat items show better average sales across urban outlets
- Medium-sized outlets generate the highest sales volume
-  Tier-1 cities dominate in overall sales
-  Dairy and Snacks are the top-selling product categories
- Outlets established earlier still perform strongly

##  Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end data analysis workflow
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Visual storytelling using Power BI
- Python scripting and charting
- SQL aggregations and pivots
- Excel-based analysis and reporting and visualiation
